# numspell
A simple C program to spell a number in English. In Linux 64 bit it takes a range of numbers from -1,000,000,000,000,000 to +1,000,000,000,000,000 since long type is 8 bytes. In systems with 4 byte longs the range will be limited by 134,217,727. Anyway, it is good enough to play.

Example:
numspell 2021

two thousand twenty one
